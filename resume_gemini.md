Resume project development by reading the gemini.md file in the root of the repository.

You have previously started work on this project, following the instructions in gemini.md, but your process was interrupted before completion.

Do not start again from the beginning. Instead:

Identify the precise step or instruction in gemini.md where your last execution stopped or failed.

Continue your work by picking up directly from that last uncompleted step.

Before proceeding, verify the current codebase for completed and working stepsâ€”skip over any parts that are already done and functional.

Your goal is to efficiently resume and finish the project by following the remaining instructions in gemini.md, always working from where you left off rather than repeating prior actions.

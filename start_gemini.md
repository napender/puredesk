Read and fully understand the gemini.md file located in the root of this project.

Your objective is to follow the instructions in this file from start to finish, using gemini.md as the single source of truth and your definitive plan.

As you create the project, develop each part as described, and systematically implement every feature or configuration specified.

Important:

Before executing each step, carefully check if it has already been implemented and is functioning correctly in the codebase.

If a step is already implemented and working, skip it and move on to the next uncompleted instruction in the file.

Your end goal: Build a fully working project that completely matches the direction and requirements in gemini.md.

Only take actions and make architectural decisions that are directly supported by instructions in gemini.mdâ€”do not introduce features or work from outside the file.
